PAC42_Tensor_Asymmetry_Azz
==========================

Letter of intent for the Tensor Asymmetry Azz Measurement to be submitted for PAC 42

This document shows that it is possible to make QE measurements of the tensor polarized
deuteron (e,e') reaction.   Our goal at this point is to get support from various theory
groups to help with the physics modivation.

Misak Sargasian ( light cone )
Wally Van Orden ( classic nuclear )
Jerry Miller ( 6 quark bag )

As we can cover a large range in Q2, it may way be at low Q2 we see the classic nuclear picture
working well and at high Q2 the 6 quark bag and/or light cone working well.
