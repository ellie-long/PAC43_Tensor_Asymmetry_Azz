\subsection{Kinematics}
\label{kinematics}

\label{EXP}
We propose to measure the tensor asymmetry $A_{zz}$ for $\XMIN<x<\XMAX$, $\QMIN$~(GeV/$c)^2 < Q^2 <\QMAX$~(GeV/$c)^2$, and $\WMIN < W_{NN} < \WMAX$~GeV and extract the tensor analyzing power $T_{20}$ for $\QMINT20$~(GeV/$c)^2 < Q^2 <\QMAXT20$~(GeV/$c)^2$. Central kinematics of the spectrometers are given in Table~\ref{RATES1}
%, estimates for the uncertainties of $A_{zz}$ are given in Tables~\ref{RATES2}-\ref{RATES3}, and estimates for the uncertainties of $T_{20}$ are given in Table\need
. Fig.~\ref{kincov} shows the planned kinematic coverage utilizing the Hall C HMS and SHMS spectrometers at forward angles.

\caption{\label{kincov} Kinematic coverage for central spectrometer settings at $Q^2=2.9~(\mathrm{GeV}/c)^2$ (H1), $1.8~(\mathrm{GeV}/c)^2$ (H2), $1.5~(\mathrm{GeV}/c)^2$ (S1), $0.7~(\mathrm{GeV}/c)^2$ (S2), $0.3~(\mathrm{GeV}/c)^2$ (H3), and $0.2~(\mathrm{GeV}/c)^2$ (S3). The grey regions are not included in our statistics estimates since they fall outside the range of electron-deuteron scattering. Darker shading represents areas with higher statistics. The solid, dashed, and dotted lines in the $W_{NN}$ plot indicate deuteron mass, deuteron mass + 50 MeV, and deuteron mass + 100 MeV, respectively. Virtual-nucleon and light cone calculations are only valid for $W_{NN}>m_D+50$~MeV.}

The polarized \TARGET target is discussed in Section~\ref{POLTARGSEC}.  The magnetic field of the target will be held constant along the beamline at all times, while the target state is alternated between a polarized and unpolarized state.
The tensor polarization and packing fraction used in the rates estimate are \PZZ\% and \PF, respectively. 
The dilution factor in the range of this measurement is shown in Fig.~\ref{fdil_plot}. The spread of the elastic peak for the dilution factor was calculated assuming a momentum resolution of $0.1\%$ for the HMS and $0.08\%$ for the SHMS.
With an incident electron beam current of \CURRENT nA, the expected deuteron luminosity is \LUMI.

The momentum bite and the acceptance were assumed to be $\Delta P = \pm 8\%$ and $\Delta\Omega = 5.6$~msr for the HMS, and $\Delta P= ^{+20\%}_{-8\%}$ 
%$-8<\Delta P <+20\%$
and $\Delta\Omega =4.4$~msr for the SHMS.

For the choice of the kinematics,
special attention was taken onto the angular and momentum limits of the spectrometers with a longitudinal polarized target: for the
HMS, $12.2^{\circ} \le \theta \le 85^{\circ}$ and $1 \le P_0 \le 7.3$ GeV/c, and for the SHMS,
$5.5^{\circ} \le \theta \le 40^{\circ}$ and $2 \le P_0 \le 11$ GeV/c. In addition, the
opening angle between the spectrometers is physically constrained to be larger than 17.5$^{\circ}$.

A total of \productiondays days of beam time is requested for production data, with an additional \overheaddays days of expected overhead.
